# NIPs (Nostr Implementation Possibilities)

Understanding the standards that power Nostr.

## What Are NIPs?

NIPs are standardized documents that define:
- Protocol features
- Implementation guidelines
- Best practices
- Extensions to Nostr

Think of them like RFCs for the internet or BIPs for Bitcoin.

## Core NIPs

### NIP-01: Basic Protocol
- Fundamental protocol flow
- Event structure
- Relay communication
- Foundation for everything

### NIP-02: Contact Lists
- Follow lists
- Petnames
- Social graphs

### NIP-04: Encrypted Direct Messages
- Private messaging
- End-to-end encryption
- Secure communication

### NIP-05: DNS-Based Verification
- Human-readable identifiers
- Verification badges
- username@domain.com format

### NIP-09: Event Deletion
- Delete posts
- Deletion requests
- Relay compliance

### NIP-10: Text Notes & Replies
- Threading
- Mentions
- Reply structure

### NIP-25: Reactions
- Likes and emoji reactions
- Engagement system

### NIP-57: Lightning Zaps
- Bitcoin tips
- Payment integration
- Creator monetization

## NIPs Supported by Nostria

Nostria supports 30+ NIPs including:
- Basic protocol (NIP-01)
- Contact lists (NIP-02)
- Encrypted DMs (NIP-04)
- Verification (NIP-05)
- Deletion (NIP-09)
- Replies (NIP-10)
- Reactions (NIP-25)
- Lightning (NIP-57)
- And many more!

## Why NIPs Matter

### Interoperability
- All Nostr apps use same standards
- Your data works everywhere
- Switch apps freely

### Innovation
- New features via new NIPs
- Community-driven development
- Backwards compatibility

### Flexibility
- Apps choose which NIPs to support
- Gradual adoption
- Experimental features

## NIP Development Process

1. **Proposal**: Someone has an idea
2. **Draft**: Write NIP specification
3. **Discussion**: Community feedback
4. **Refinement**: Improve based on feedback
5. **Adoption**: Apps implement it
6. **Standard**: Becomes widely used
