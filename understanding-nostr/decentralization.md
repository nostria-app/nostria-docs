# Decentralization Explained

Understanding what makes Nostr and Nostria different from traditional social media.

## What Is Decentralization?

**Centralized (Traditional):**
- Single company controls everything
- All data in one place
- Company makes all rules
- Can shut down anytime

**Decentralized (Nostr):**
- No single point of control
- Data spread across network
- Community-driven rules
- Can't be shut down

## Benefits of Decentralization

### Freedom
- No corporate overlords
- Can't be banned arbitrarily
- Choose your own experience
- Control your own data

### Resilience
- Network keeps working if nodes fail
- No single point of failure
- Censorship resistant
- Always available

### Privacy
- You control your data
- No corporate surveillance
- No data mining
- No targeted ads

### Innovation
- Anyone can build

- User choice

## How It Works in Practice

- Your identity (keys) belongs to you
- Content stored on multiple relays
- Choose which relays to use
- Switch apps anytime
