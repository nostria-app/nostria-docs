# Relays

Understanding the backbone of the Nostr network.

## What Are Relays?

Relays are servers that:
- Store your posts
- Forward messages
- Sync data across network
- Enable communication

Think of them like email servers, but for social media.

## How Relays Work

1. You publish a post
2. Sent to your connected relays
3. Relays store and broadcast it
4. Others fetch from their relays
5. They see your post!

## Choosing Relays

**Considerations:**
- Speed and reliability
- Geographic location
- Privacy policies
- Storage duration
- Cost (free vs. paid)
