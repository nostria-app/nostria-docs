## Step 1: Access Nostria

Choose your preferred platform:

- **Web App**: Visit [nostria.app](https://nostria.app) in your web browser
- **Desktop App**: Download from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n7f0twq0d8g) or [GitHub releases](https://github.com/nostria-app/nostria/releases)

## Step 2: Create Your Account

Creating a Nostria account is incredibly simple:

1. Click the **"Sign Up"** or **"Get Started"** button
2. Your cryptographic keys will be automatically generated
3. That's it! No email, no phone number, no verification required

### Important: Save Your Keys! 🔑

After signing up, you'll receive:

- **Public Key (npub)**: Your unique identifier, like a username—share this!
- **Private Key (nsec)**: Your password—NEVER share this with anyone!

**⚠️ Critical**: Save your private key in a safe place! There's no password reset. If you lose your private key, you lose access to your account permanently.

We recommend:
- Writing it down on paper and storing it securely
- Using a password manager
- Storing it in multiple safe locations
- NEVER sharing it with anyone, including Nostria support

Don't worry—you can always update this later!
