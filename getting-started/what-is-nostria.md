# What is Nostria?

Nostria is a decentralized social media platform that puts you in control of your digital social life. Built on the open Nostr protocol, Nostria represents a fundamental shift from traditional, centralized social media platforms.

## The Nostria Difference

### 🔓 True Decentralization

Unlike Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, Nostria doesn't rely on a single company's servers. Instead, it uses the Nostr protocol—a decentralized network where:

- **No single entity controls the network**: Your account and data aren't owned by a corporation
- **Censorship resistance**: No central authority can ban you or remove your content
- **Freedom of choice**: Pick your own relays (servers) or run your own

### 🚀 Built for Everyone

Nostria makes decentralized social media accessible with:

- **Fast & responsive interface**: Designed for mainstream users, not just tech enthusiasts
- **Cross-platform availability**: Works on web browsers, desktop computers, and mobile devices
- **Simple onboarding**: Create an account in just two clicks—no email or phone number required

### 💾 Your Data, Your Control

With Nostria, you truly own your data:

- **Data portability**: Take your profile and posts anywhere
- **No vendor lock-in**: Your identity isn't tied to a specific company
- **Privacy-focused**: Only share what you choose to share
- **Automated backups**: Keep your content safe (Premium feature)

## Core Principles

Nostria is built on these fundamental values:

1. **User Ownership**: You control your account, data, and experience
2. **Privacy**: No tracking, no data mining, no ads targeting
3. **Freedom**: Speak freely without fear of arbitrary censorship
4. **Transparency**: Open protocol, open source, open community
5. **Innovation**: Custom algorithms, extensibility, and continuous improvement

## How It Works

Nostria connects to the Nostr network using:

- **Your identity**: A cryptographic key pair that proves you are you
- **Relays**: Servers that store and forward your messages
- **Clients**: Apps like Nostria that provide the user interface

When you post on Nostria, your message is signed with your private key and sent to relays. Other users can then retrieve your posts from these relays. It's like email—decentralized and interoperable.
